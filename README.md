# üñ•Ô∏è ‚Ä∫ BASE - Beginner's Abstract Simplified Environment

BASE (Beginner's Abstract Simplified Environment) is designed as an introductory, text-based programming environment that simplifies the learning process for beginners. It offers a straightforward syntax and a set of basic instructions to help users grasp fundamental programming concepts.

## üîë ‚Ä∫ Key Features of BASE:
- Simplified Syntax: BASE uses a minimalistic syntax that focuses on essential programming constructs, making it easy for beginners to understand and apply.

- Text-Based Interface: The entire programming environment operates through text commands and outputs, providing a clear and direct way to interact with the program.

- Basic Commands: BASE includes fundamental commands such as variable declaration, outputting text and numbers, input handling, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.

- Interactive Learning: It encourages hands-on learning by allowing users to immediately see the results of their commands in the console, facilitating quick feedback and understanding.

## üìö ‚Ä∫ Usage Scenarios

- Education: Ideal for educational purposes, BASE serves as a stepping stone for beginners to understand programming logic and syntax before moving on to more complex languages.

- Prototyping: It can be used for quick prototyping and testing of simple algorithms and logic, allowing users to experiment with programming concepts without the overhead of more advanced languages.

- Skill Development: BASE helps users develop fundamental programming skills such as variable usage, basic control flow (e.g., if-else conditions), and arithmetic operations.

## üìñ ‚Ä∫ Commands
- `COMMENT (comment)` - Adds a comment.
- `START` - Marks the beginning of a program.
- `END` - Marks the end of a program.
- `SET (name) = (value)` - Creates a variable with a specified value.
- `SAY (type)(value)` - Outputs something in the console of a specified type (text, num, or var for variable).
- `INPUT (value)` - Displays an input field in the console.
- `WAIT (value in seconds)` - Pauses execution for a specified time.
- `IF (condition)` - Executes a block of code under a specified condition.
- `END IF` - Ends an IF block.
- `ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE` - Perform arithmetic operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è ‚Ä∫ Run a BASE-File
Firstly you have to create your file with the ending .base, where you write your code. Then you download and execute the interpreter, which will ask you which .base file you will run. The .base file HAS to be in the same directory as the interpreter, or else, it wont work.
